## Description

The Handwritten Alphabet Image Recognition project is a machine learning-based system designed to recognize and classify handwritten alphabet characters. This repository contains the necessary code and resources to train the model and deploy it for recognizing handwritten alphabet characters from images.

## Features

- Trained machine learning model for handwritten alphabet recognition.
- Sample code to preprocess images and perform predictions using the model.
- Example notebooks for training and evaluation.
- Pretrained weights (if applicable).
- Data preprocessing scripts.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/ashfaq-khan14/Image--recognising-Hanfswritten-Alphets/tree/main
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download or prepare your own dataset of handwritten alphabet characters.

4. Preprocess the dataset:

   ```bash
   python preprocess.py --data_path /path/to/dataset
   ```

5. Train the model:

   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path /path/to/preprocessed/data
   ```

6. Once the model is trained, you can use it for prediction:

   ```python
   from model import AlphabetRecognizer

   recognizer = AlphabetRecognizer(model_path='path/to/saved/model')
   image = load_and_preprocess_image('path/to/test/image')
   prediction = recognizer.predict(image)
   print(f"Predicted character: {prediction}")
   ```

7. Feel free to explore the example notebooks for more detailed usage and visualization.
